# Doctoring record: product-goal-directive.md (the `/goal` 4000-character cap)

- **Date:** 2026-08-30
- **Subject:** `/goal`'s session-condition field truncates at 4000 characters.
  The owner's full nine-section autonomous PR review→fix→merge→develop loop
  directive is ~7900 characters and would lose specific, deliberate
  constraints if summarized to fit. Introduced
  [`docs/product-goal-directive.md`](../product-goal-directive.md) to hold the
  directive verbatim, with no length limit, and linked it from `AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §10 so any agent reads it
  during normal onboarding regardless of how a loop was started.
- **Decision record:** none yet in `docs/adr/` — this is a documentation/process
  change, not an architecture decision; §7 of `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md`
  ("Durable knowledge lives in the repo / Project / KG, NOT in an agent's
  private memory") is the binding convention this follows.
- **PR:** ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1429.

## What changed

- New file `docs/product-goal-directive.md`: the nine-section directive
  recorded verbatim (Korean, as authored), each section given a short English
  heading, plus a `/goal`-sized pointer text a future session can paste in
  instead of the full directive.
- `AGENTS.md`'s `<!-- CWL-ENTRY -->` read-first block, `CLAUDE.md`'s "Read
  first" section, and `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §10 ("Current state") each
  gained one linking sentence to the new file.

## Review findings and reconciliation (Devin Review, PR #1429)

Devin Review's automated pass on this PR raised two findings against the new
file, both confirmed valid and fixed in place (not by editing the verbatim
quoted directive text, which is meant to preserve the owner's own wording
unmodified):

1. **Missing traceability record.** The PR introduced a new standing policy
   (the `/goal`-pointer mechanism itself) without a `docs/doctoring/` entry,
   contradicting the pattern this repo already follows for standing-policy and
   infra changes (e.g. `docs/doctoring/contextual-orchestrator-vendored-sidecar.md`,
   `docs/doctoring/noema-orchestrator-free-zdr.md`). This file is that record.
2. **Naming section (§5) contradicts existing binding conventions.** The
   verbatim directive text (a) uses "wardnet" as an example of an "old name"
   to rename away from, when `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §3/§10 records
   `waf-ids-ai-soc` → **wardnet** as an already-completed rename — wardnet is
   the current canonical name, not a legacy one; and (b) says all DB names
   violating the snake_case convention "shall be replaced entirely," which
   contradicts `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §7's explicit grandfather clause,
   "DB object names = 2+ word snake_case (don't rename existing Camel/Pascal)."
   Read literally and combined with this org's stated "full autonomy, do not
   ask the user" convention, an agent following §5's wording alone could
   force-rename the wardnet product or existing database objects and violate
   the canonical schema/naming contract that a completed rename already
   established.

   Resolved per `docs/product-goal-directive.md`'s own stated conflict
   policy ("Where this directive and those documents conflict, resolve the
   conflict and update whichever document is wrong — do not silently pick
   one"): added a reconciliation note directly after §5's quoted text (not
   inside the quote) stating that `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §7 governs,
   that the snake_case rule applies to **new** DB objects only, and that
   wardnet must not be treated as a rename target.

## Audit trail

- `docs/product-goal-directive.md` — the directive itself and the
  reconciliation note.
- `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §3, §7, §10 — the naming-history and DB-naming
  conventions this record reconciles against.
- ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1429 — the PR carrying this change and Devin
  Review's findings.
