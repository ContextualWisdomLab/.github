# Doctoring record: product-goal-directive.md (the `/goal` 4000-character cap)

- **Date:** 2026-08-30
- **Subject:** `/goal`'s session-condition field truncates at 4000 characters.
  The owner's full nine-section autonomous PR review→fix→merge→develop loop
  directive is ~7900 characters and would lose specific, deliberate
  constraints if summarized to fit. Introduced
  [`docs/product-goal-directive.md`](../product-goal-directive.md) to hold the
  directive verbatim, with no length limit, and linked it from `AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §10 so any agent reads it
  during normal onboarding regardless of how a loop was started.
- **Decision record:** none yet in `docs/adr/` — this is a documentation/process
  change, not an architecture decision; §7 of `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md`
  ("Durable knowledge lives in the repo / Project / KG, NOT in an agent's
  private memory") is the binding convention this follows.
- **PR:** ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1429.

## What changed

- New file `docs/product-goal-directive.md`: the nine-section directive
  recorded verbatim (Korean, as authored), each section given a short English
  heading, plus a `/goal`-sized pointer text a future session can paste in
  instead of the full directive.
- `AGENTS.md`'s `<!-- CWL-ENTRY -->` read-first block, `CLAUDE.md`'s "Read
  first" section, and `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §10 ("Current state") each
  gained one linking sentence to the new file.

## Review findings and reconciliation (Devin Review, PR #1429)

Devin Review's automated pass on this PR raised two findings against the new
file, both confirmed valid and fixed in place (not by editing the verbatim
quoted directive text, which is meant to preserve the owner's own wording
unmodified):

1. **Missing traceability record.** The PR introduced a new standing policy
   (the `/goal`-pointer mechanism itself) without a `docs/doctoring/` entry,
   contradicting the pattern this repo already follows for standing-policy and
   infra changes (e.g. `docs/doctoring/contextual-orchestrator-vendored-sidecar.md`,
   `docs/doctoring/noema-orchestrator-free-zdr.md`). This file is that record.
2. **Naming section (§5) contradicts existing binding conventions.** The
   verbatim directive text (a) uses "wardnet" as an example of an "old name"
   to rename away from, when `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §3/§10 records
   `waf-ids-ai-soc` → **wardnet** as an already-completed rename — wardnet is
   the current canonical name, not a legacy one; and (b) says all DB names
   violating the snake_case convention "shall be replaced entirely," which
   contradicts `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §7's explicit grandfather clause,
   "DB object names = 2+ word snake_case (don't rename existing Camel/Pascal)."
   Read literally and combined with this org's stated "full autonomy, do not
   ask the user" convention, an agent following §5's wording alone could
   force-rename the wardnet product or existing database objects and violate
   the canonical schema/naming contract that a completed rename already
   established.

   Resolved per `docs/product-goal-directive.md`'s own stated conflict
   policy ("Where this directive and those documents conflict, resolve the
   conflict and update whichever document is wrong — do not silently pick
   one"): added a reconciliation note directly after §5's quoted text (not
   inside the quote) stating that `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §7 governs,
   that the snake_case rule applies to **new** DB objects only, and that
   wardnet must not be treated as a rename target.

## Follow-up findings (CodeRabbit, PR #1429)

CodeRabbit's automated pass raised two further findings, both verified and
fixed:

3. **Markdown lint (MD040).** The `/goal` pointer example's fenced code block
   had no language identifier. Changed the opening fence to ` ```text ` since
   the block is a command example, not executable code.
4. **Section 8 read as CI routing policy.** Section 8's quoted text describes
   `contextual-orchestrator`'s general auto-discovery capability across all
   five provider secrets — a product-level design principle, not CI routing
   policy. Read in isolation, an agent could mistake it for license to loosen
   which pool `OpenCode`/`Noema`/`Strix` route through. Added a note (not
   inside the quote) stating that pool/credential-scope routing is governed
   exclusively by `docs/adr/0003-contextual-orchestrator-vendored-free-zdr.md`:
   `OpenCode`/`Noema` → fail-closed `orchestrator/free`; `Strix` →
   `orchestrator/auto`; private/internal targets require an attested
   ZDR-only catalog.

## Follow-up: Strix migrated to `orchestrator/free` (2026-08-30)

Finding 4 above recorded the CodeRabbit-flagged reconciliation note as of
PR #1429: `Strix` was, at that time, the one CI consumer still on the
provider-diverse `orchestrator/auto` pool. That split is now superseded by an
explicit product decision, not a further reinterpretation of section 8:
`Strix` also routes through `orchestrator/free`. See
[`docs/adr/0020-strix-orchestrator-free-pool.md`](../adr/0020-strix-orchestrator-free-pool.md)
for the decision and its verification that the provider-family-diversity cap
in `scripts/ci/contextual_orchestrator_review_policy.py` already applied
identically to both pools (no code change was needed there), and for the
residual risk this migration documents rather than hides. `docs/adr/0003-contextual-orchestrator-vendored-free-zdr.md`
keeps its original Strix-specific decision text as history, with a new
Amendment section pointing to ADR-0020; `docs/product-goal-directive.md`'s
own note (added for finding 4) got a matching dated follow-up paragraph
rather than being rewritten in place.

## Audit trail

- `docs/product-goal-directive.md` — the directive itself and the
  reconciliation note.
- `docs/CWL-MASTER-CONTEXT.md` §3, §7, §10 — the naming-history and DB-naming
  conventions this record reconciles against.
- ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1429 — the PR carrying this change and Devin
  Review's findings.
- `docs/adr/0020-strix-orchestrator-free-pool.md` — the 2026-08-30 decision
  that superseded finding 4's Strix/`orchestrator/auto` reconciliation note.
