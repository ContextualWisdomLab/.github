# GitHub 422 inline-comment fallback cites trusted path:line

검토 기준일: **2026-08-13**

## Incident

When GitHub rejects an OpenCode `REQUEST_CHANGES` review because one or more
inline comments cannot attach, the publisher already falls back to a PR-level
body and does not copy suggested diffs into that body. The fallback sentence
said only “the cited finding lines.” Authors then had to open the workflow log
or control JSON to learn *which* `path:line` GitHub refused (GitHub, n.d.-a,
n.d.-b). That is weaker than the line-anchored review artifact modern code
review expects (Bacchelli & Bird, 2013).

## Decision

`scripts/ci/opencode_inline_comment_fallback.py` reads the trusted control
JSON, keeps first-seen safe relative `path` plus positive integer `line`
pairs, and appends them to the fallback body as `` `path:line` `` list
items. Unsafe paths (`..`, absolute, drive, backslash) and non-positive
lines are omitted. A decimal digit string such as `"9"` is accepted
because LLM control JSON often emits line as text (CWE-20). An empty
location set is stated explicitly.

The publisher calls this helper from `build_inline_comment_failure_body`
with the same control object used to build the inline `comments` array.
Suggested diffs stay out of the PR-level body.

## Verification contract

- `tests/test_opencode_inline_comment_fallback.py` pins safe-pair extraction,
  the exact location list, the empty-set sentence, CLI success, and fail-closed
  unreadable control input.
- `tests/test_opencode_agent_contract.py` and
  `scripts/ci/test_strix_quick_gate.sh` pin the workflow call with
  `$control_json`.

## Rollback

If GitHub later accepts off-diff comments, keep citing the attempted
`path:line` in the fallback. Do not restore a location-free sentence.
