# Architecture — ContextualWisdomLab `.github`

This repository is the organization control plane. It is not naruon and it
does not own product data. Sibling products remain standalone modules; this
repo publishes org profile assets, reusable required workflows, and the
review/merge schedulers those products consume.

## System context

```mermaid

  Buyer["Commercial buyer / reviewer"]
  Agents["Agents on AGENTS.md"]
  Project["GitHub Project #1"]
  Hub["This repo: org .github"]
  Products["Owned products<br/>naruon · orchestrator · engines"]
  Runner["Required workflows in each repo context"]

```

## R coverage classification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Log["Bounded testthat log ≤ 2 MiB"]
  Marker{"literal 'Error: Test failures'"}
  Regex["FAIL_SUMMARY_RE and peer regexes"]
  Deny["False: no deferral"]
  Decide["Cardinality + package allowlist"]

  Log --> Marker
  Marker -->|"absent"| Deny
  Marker -->|"present"| Regex
  Regex -->|"no summary or mismatch"| Deny
  Regex -->|"counts match allowed missing packages"| Decide
```

The marker check is a necessary-condition rejection. It does not authorize
coverage deferral by itself.

## Control-plane data flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant PR as Pull request
  participant RW as Required workflows
  participant OC as OpenCode reviewer
  participant SV as sandboxed_verify / web E2E
  participant MS as Merge scheduler

  PR->>RW: pull_request_target on trusted base
  RW->>OC: bounded evidence + NVIDIA NIM / OpenCode
  OC->>SV: PoC command in isolated copy
  SV-->>OC: redacted stdout/stderr + command metadata
  OC-->>PR: APPROVE or request changes
  MS->>PR: merge only on current-head approval + green checks
```

## Trust boundaries

- Required review workflows execute **base-branch** scripts. A PR that edits
  those workflows cannot widen its own `pull_request_target` token.
- Reviewer agents stay `edit: deny`. They judge; they do not implement.
- Sandbox helpers copy the workspace, drop secret environment values unless
  explicitly allowlisted by **name**, and run subprocesses with `shell=False`.
- Logs and review receipts redact credential shapes (tokens, bearer values,
  known provider prefixes). They do not mask operational PII that the
  control plane must process.
- LLM and scheduled agents bind `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY` (env may be
  `NVIDIA_API_KEY`). They never use `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. Existing
  review-agent key schemes stay unchanged.

## Quality gates

`scripts/ci/` ships with 100% statement/branch coverage and 100% docstrings.
CI installs Python tools only with `pip install --require-hashes`. Contract
tests pin workflow structure and governance prose so drift fails closed.
