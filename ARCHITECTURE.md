# Architecture — ContextualWisdomLab `.github`

This repository is the organization control plane. It is not naruon and it
does not own product data. Sibling products remain standalone modules; this
repo publishes org profile assets, reusable required workflows, and the
review/merge schedulers those products consume.

## System context

```mermaid

  Buyer["Commercial buyer / reviewer"]
  Agents["Agents on AGENTS.md"]
  Project["GitHub Project #1"]
  Hub["This repo: org .github"]
  Products["Owned products<br/>naruon · orchestrator · engines"]
  Runner["Required workflows in each repo context"]

## Trusted-uv installer platform gate

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Host["Developer or CI host"]
  Gate{"sys.platform is linux and machine is x86_64?"}
  Install["Verify pinned archive, version, and cache"]
  Reject["Fail closed: unsupported runner"]

  Host --> Gate
  Gate -->|"no"| Reject
  Gate -->|"yes"| Install
```

Unit tests simulate the Linux x86_64 runner and clear the process cache
so they measure verification, not the host-architecture gate. CWE-670:
a stale cache hit after the monkeypatch would skip the path under test.

## Control-plane data flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant PR as Pull request
  participant RW as Required workflows
  participant OC as OpenCode reviewer
  participant SV as sandboxed_verify / web E2E
  participant MS as Merge scheduler

  PR->>RW: pull_request_target on trusted base
  RW->>OC: bounded evidence + NVIDIA NIM / OpenCode
  OC->>SV: PoC command in isolated copy
  SV-->>OC: redacted stdout/stderr + command metadata
  OC-->>PR: APPROVE or request changes
  MS->>PR: merge only on current-head approval + green checks
```

## Trust boundaries

- Required review workflows execute **base-branch** scripts.
- Reviewer agents stay `edit: deny`.
- Logs redact credential shapes. They do not mask operational PII.
- LLM and scheduled agents bind `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY`. They never use
  `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Rust remains the psychometric arithmetic owner.

## Quality gates

`scripts/ci/` ships with 100% statement/branch coverage and 100%
docstrings.
