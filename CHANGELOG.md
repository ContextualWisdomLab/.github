## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a trusted pull-request comment router for `@cwl-noema-review` and review-only `@opencode-agent` dispatches, with an organization sweep, exact-head receipts, repository allowlisting, fixed runners, immutable checkout pins, and a permanent 100% statement/branch/docstring quality gate.
- Added exact-base `uv.lock` materialization that reconstructs standalone nested projects with a checksum-pinned official `uv` exporter, isolated frozen/offline execution, strict exact-pin and SHA-256 output validation, and complete Python 3.10/3.14 quality evidence.

### Fixed

- Redacted credential-shaped stdout, stderr, timeout evidence, and bounded backend/frontend service-log tails emitted by sandboxed verification and web-E2E subprocesses before those values become CI or review evidence. The boundary now canonicalizes safe ANSI styling and fails closed on single- or multiline rendering controls, scans JSON keys and opaque string values without corrupting scalar types or result schemas, preserves benign metadata and diagnostic domains, removes authorization headers, URL userinfo, and private-key blocks, protects raw and escaped explicitly allowed values before setup and tail selection, handles separated credential options, preserves markers and line boundaries, falls back safely on excessive JSON nesting, and parses high-volume diagnostics within bounded time. Normal executed argv, child exit, timeout, readiness, and network behavior remains unchanged; ambiguous short or fixed-evidence-colliding allowed values and setup/launch exceptions return redacted code `126` evidence before a raw traceback can escape.
- Bounded the Strix quality self-test's deterministic timeout fixtures to 3-second process and 5-second fake-sleep budgets so exact-head policy evidence completes inside the existing job limit without changing production Strix scanner timeouts, providers, credentials, or review semantics.
- Allowed commas and ASCII parentheses in the bounded Strix changed-file path policy so legal tracked Packrat fixtures can receive exact-head security analysis, while rejecting raw `..` components before normalization and keeping controls, backslashes, whitespace ambiguity, and shell punctuation fail-closed.
- Bound each review-agent invocation key to the wrapper's complete canonical payload, including the base branch and requesting actor; altered fields with a valid-format key now fail before durable-leader election or forwarding, and wrapper write permission is job-scoped.
- Bound both trusted-uv quality jobs to `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` and added a permanent two-checkout regression contract so exact-head compatibility, coverage, docstring, and compilation claims cannot silently measure GitHub's generated pull-request merge revision.
- Made Strix treat only a single LiteLLM provider-error line containing NVIDIA NIM context and model-catalog 404 evidence as cross-model fallback evidence, rejecting cross-line signal assembly and provider-like target source literals; moved the public default to Nemotron 3 Super 120B and added a second NVIDIA hosted candidate before GitHub Models without neutralizing reported vulnerabilities.
