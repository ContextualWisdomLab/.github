Semantic Versioning where the repository publishes a release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a trusted pull-request comment router for `@cwl-noema-review` and review-only `@opencode-agent` dispatches, with an organization sweep, exact-head receipts, repository allowlisting, fixed runners, immutable checkout pins, and a permanent 100% statement/branch/docstring quality gate.
- Added exact-base `uv.lock` materialization that reconstructs standalone nested projects with a checksum-pinned official `uv` exporter, isolated frozen/offline execution, strict exact-pin and SHA-256 output validation, and complete Python 3.10/3.14 quality evidence.

### Fixed

- Strix 스캔 게이트의 폴백(fallback) 로직에서 GitHub 모델 종료에 따른 410 (brownout) 오류를 정상적인 폴백 트리거로 인식하도록 수정했습니다.
- 샌드박스 검증 스크립트(`sandboxed_verify.py`, `sandboxed_web_e2e.py`)의 하위 프로세스 실행 시 캡처된 표준 출력과 표준 에러에 로그 데이터 마스킹(redaction) 로직을 추가하여 민감한 정보의 노출을 방지했습니다.

- Bounded the Strix quality self-test's deterministic timeout fixtures to 3-second process and 5-second fake-sleep budgets so exact-head policy evidence completes inside the existing job limit without changing production Strix scanner timeouts, providers, credentials, or review semantics.
- Allowed commas and ASCII parentheses in the bounded Strix changed-file path policy so legal tracked Packrat fixtures can receive exact-head security analysis, while rejecting raw `..` components before normalization and keeping controls, backslashes, whitespace ambiguity, and shell punctuation fail-closed.
- Bound each review-agent invocation key to the wrapper's complete canonical payload, including the base branch and requesting actor; altered fields with a valid-format key now fail before durable-leader election or forwarding, and wrapper write permission is job-scoped.
- Bound both trusted-uv quality jobs to `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` and added a permanent two-checkout regression contract so exact-head compatibility, coverage, docstring, and compilation claims cannot silently measure GitHub's generated pull-request merge revision.
- Made Strix treat only a single LiteLLM provider-error line containing NVIDIA NIM context and model-catalog 404 evidence as cross-model fallback evidence, rejecting cross-line signal assembly and provider-like target source literals; moved the public default to Nemotron 3 Super 120B and added a second NVIDIA hosted candidate before GitHub Models without neutralizing reported vulnerabilities.
