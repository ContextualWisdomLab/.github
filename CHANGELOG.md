# Changelog

All notable changes to the organization automation repository are documented in
this file. The format follows Keep a Changelog, and versioned releases follow
Semantic Versioning where the repository publishes a release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a trusted pull-request comment router for `@cwl-noema-review` and review-only `@opencode-agent` dispatches, with an organization sweep, exact-head receipts, repository allowlisting, fixed runners, immutable checkout pins, and a permanent 100% statement/branch/docstring quality gate.
- Added exact-base `uv.lock` materialization that reconstructs standalone nested projects with a checksum-pinned official `uv` exporter, isolated frozen/offline execution, strict exact-pin and SHA-256 output validation, and complete Python 3.10/3.14 quality evidence.

### Fixed

- Omitted leftover 422-fallback paths that contain `-->`, `<!--`, or a suggestion fence so a leftover cannot close `<!-- opencode-review-overview -->` or reopen an applyable GitHub suggestion block (CWE-116).
- Materialized base Python locks only when every package line is an exact SHA-256 pin or a bounded relative `-r`/`--requirement` include. A lone `--require-hashes` directive, a dotted include such as `./lock.txt`, or `-r other-hashes.txt` no longer enters the trusted build context.
- Labeled leftover LEFT deleted-line ranges as `path:start-end LEFT` in the GitHub 422 fallback so authors can tell leftover deleted-side ranges from attachable RIGHT hunks.
- Cited leftover OpenCode findings as `path:start-end` in the GitHub 422 inline-comment fallback when control JSON carries a trusted `start_line`. Single-line leftovers stay `path:line`. An inverted start after the end is omitted rather than printed as a false range.
- Named each trusted `path:line` in the OpenCode GitHub 422 inline-comment fallback so a refused attach still tells the author the exact current-head location instead of a generic “cited finding lines” sentence. Decimal digit strings such as `"9"` are accepted as line numbers so LLM control JSON cannot drop a valid location (CWE-20). Paths containing backticks or HTML metacharacters are omitted so a receipt cannot break the overview Markdown.
- Bounded the Strix quality self-test's deterministic timeout fixtures to 3-second process and 5-second fake-sleep budgets so exact-head policy evidence completes inside the existing job limit without changing production Strix scanner timeouts, providers, credentials, or review semantics.
- Allowed commas and ASCII parentheses in the bounded Strix changed-file path policy so legal tracked Packrat fixtures can receive exact-head security analysis, while rejecting raw `..` components before normalization and keeping controls, backslashes, whitespace ambiguity, and shell punctuation fail-closed.
- Bound each review-agent invocation key to the wrapper's complete canonical payload, including the base branch and requesting actor; altered fields with a valid-format key now fail before durable-leader election or forwarding, and wrapper write permission is job-scoped.
- Bound both trusted-uv quality jobs to `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` and added a permanent two-checkout regression contract so exact-head compatibility, coverage, docstring, and compilation claims cannot silently measure GitHub's generated pull-request merge revision.
- Made Strix treat only a single LiteLLM provider-error line containing NVIDIA NIM context and model-catalog 404 evidence as cross-model fallback evidence, rejecting cross-line signal assembly and provider-like target source literals; moved the public default to Nemotron 3 Super 120B and added a second NVIDIA hosted candidate before GitHub Models without neutralizing reported vulnerabilities.
